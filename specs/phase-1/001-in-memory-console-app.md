## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add New Tasks (Priority: P1)

A user wants to add a new task to their todo list with a title and optional description. They interact with the CLI menu to select the "Add task" option, enter the required title and optional description, and see the task added with a unique ID.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability that enables all other functionality - without the ability to add tasks, the application has no purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a task with a title and description, then viewing the task list to confirm the task was added with a unique ID and proper status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is at the main menu, **When** user selects "Add task" and enters a valid title, **Then** a new task is created with a unique auto-incremented ID and "incomplete" status
2. **Given** user is adding a task, **When** user enters an empty title, **Then** an error message is displayed and no task is created
3. **Given** user is adding a task, **When** user enters a title and optional description, **Then** a new task is created with both title and description stored

---

### User Story 2 - View All Tasks (Priority: P1)

A user wants to see all their tasks in a clear, readable format that shows the ID, title, completion status, and description. They select "View all tasks" from the menu and see a formatted list or table.

**Why this priority**: This is a core function that allows users to see their tasks and understand their current state - essential for the application's primary purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding tasks, then viewing the task list to confirm all tasks are displayed with proper formatting and status indicators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has multiple tasks in the system, **When** user selects "View all tasks", **Then** all tasks are displayed in a clear table format with ID, title, status indicator, and description
2. **Given** user has no tasks in the system, **When** user selects "View all tasks", **Then** a message indicates there are no tasks to display
3. **Given** user has tasks with different completion statuses, **When** user views the task list, **Then** completed tasks are clearly marked differently from incomplete tasks

---

### User Story 3 - Update Task Details (Priority: P2)

A user wants to modify an existing task's title or description. They select "Update task" from the menu, provide the task ID, and enter new values for the fields they want to change.

**Why this priority**: Allows users to maintain and refine their tasks over time, which is important for a practical todo application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by updating a task's title and description, then viewing the task list to confirm the changes were applied correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has existing tasks, **When** user selects "Update task" and provides a valid task ID and new title, **Then** the task's title is updated while other fields remain unchanged
2. **Given** user attempts to update a non-existent task, **When** user provides an invalid task ID, **Then** an error message is displayed and no changes are made
3. **Given** user updates only the description of a task, **When** user leaves the title field blank, **Then** only the description is updated while the title remains unchanged

---

### User Story 4 - Delete Tasks (Priority: P2)

A user wants to remove completed or unwanted tasks from their list. They select "Delete task" from the menu, provide the task ID, and confirm the deletion.

**Why this priority**: Essential for maintaining a clean and manageable task list - users need to be able to remove tasks they no longer need.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deleting a task, then viewing the task list to confirm the task is no longer present.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has existing tasks, **When** user selects "Delete task" and provides a valid task ID, **Then** the task is permanently removed from the system
2. **Given** user attempts to delete a non-existent task, **When** user provides an invalid task ID, **Then** an error message is displayed and no changes are made
3. **Given** user deletes a task, **When** user views the task list afterward, **Then** the deleted task does not appear in the list

---

### User Story 5 - Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete (Priority: P1)

A user wants to update the completion status of a task when they finish or restart work on it. They select "Toggle complete" from the menu, provide the task ID, and see the status change.

**Why this priority**: This is a core function that enables the todo list's primary purpose - tracking which tasks are completed and which still need attention.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by toggling a task's completion status, then viewing the task list to confirm the status indicator has changed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has an incomplete task, **When** user selects "Toggle complete" and provides the task ID, **Then** the task's status changes to "complete"
2. **Given** user has a completed task, **When** user selects "Toggle complete" and provides the task ID, **Then** the task's status changes to "incomplete"
3. **Given** user attempts to toggle completion status of a non-existent task, **When** user provides an invalid task ID, **Then** an error message is displayed and no changes are made

---

### User Story 6 - Navigate CLI Menu (Priority: P1)

A user wants to interact with the application through a clear, intuitive menu system that allows them to access all functionality. They see a numbered menu and can select options by entering the corresponding number.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary interface through which users interact with the application - without a functional menu system, other features are inaccessible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by navigating through all menu options and confirming each option performs its intended function.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user is at the main menu, **When** user enters a valid menu option number, **Then** the corresponding functionality is executed
2. **Given** user enters an invalid menu option, **When** user submits the choice, **Then** an error message is displayed and the menu is shown again
3. **Given** user wants to exit the application, **When** user selects option 6 (Exit), **Then** the application terminates gracefully

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user enters non-integer input where an integer is required (e.g., for task ID)?
- How does the system handle very long titles or descriptions that might break the display format?
- What happens when a user tries to update or delete a task after another user has already deleted it (not applicable for single-user in-memory app, but for future phases)?
- How does the system handle special characters in titles and descriptions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
