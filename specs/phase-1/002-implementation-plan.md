# Implementation Plan for Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo Application

**Plan ID**: phase-1-implementation-plan
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: December 31, 2025
**Author**: sharjeel
**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/sharrjeel6636/hackathon-todo
**Spec Reference**: specs/phase-1/001-in-memory-console-app.md (Version 1.1)
**Constitution Adherence**: FULL - Zero manual code writing. All code generated exclusively by Claude Code via iterative spec refinement.

## Technical Context

Python 3.13+ as specified in the project constitution and feature requirements.
UV for dependency management and project scripting as required by Phase I constraints.
In-memory storage using a Python list to hold Task dataclass objects as specified in the project structure.

## Constitution Check

Based on the project constitution, this implementation must:
- [x] Follow Spec-Kit Plus slash commands with constitution adherence checks
- [x] Use Claude Code exclusively for all code generation
- [x] Maintain traceability and reproducibility of all artifacts
- [x] Implement security and reliability measures appropriate for the phase
- [x] Follow modularity and maintainability principles for iterative evolution
- [x] Maintain progressive complexity from in-memory console to future phases

All constitution requirements have been verified and implemented in this plan.

## Gates

- [x] All technology choices align with Phase I constraints (Python 3.13+, UV, in-memory only)
- [x] No manual code writing - all code must be generated by Claude Code
- [x] Project structure matches requirements exactly
- [x] Implementation plan adheres to constitution principles

## Phase 0: Research

Research tasks to resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers.
- [x] Determine Python version requirements
- [x] Define UV configuration approach
- [x] Design in-memory storage implementation
- [x] Verify technology stack compliance with constitution
- [x] Confirm project structure alignment

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

- [x] Data model design based on feature requirements - completed in data-model.md
- [x] API contracts defined in todo-api-contract.md
- [x] Quickstart guide created in quickstart.md
- [x] Agent context updated with new technologies
