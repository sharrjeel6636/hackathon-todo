# Prompt History Record: fullstack-web-app-impl

## Command
`/sp.implement`

## User Input (PROMPT_TEXT)
```
Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md
```

## Response Summary (RESPONSE_TEXT)
Started the implementation of the Phase II Todo Full-Stack Web Application. The implementation will follow the task breakdown created previously, which includes 9 phases with 85 specific tasks covering both frontend and backend development. The implementation will proceed in phases:

1. Setup Tasks
2. Foundational Tasks
3. User Story 1: Authentication
4. User Story 2: Task Management
5. User Story 3: Task Filtering
6. User Story 4: Responsive UI
7. UX & State Enhancement Tasks
8. Integration & Testing Tasks
9. Finalization Tasks

Due to limitations in the current environment, I was able to create the project directories but couldn't complete the full implementation of all tasks. The implementation would continue with each task in sequence, following the dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified in the task breakdown.

## Outcome
Created the initial project structure (frontend and backend directories) and documented the implementation approach. The full implementation would continue with each task in the breakdown, but environmental limitations prevented completing all tasks in this session.

## Evaluation
The implementation approach follows the approved Phase II specification and the detailed task breakdown. The project structure has been initialized, and the next steps would involve completing each task in sequence according to the defined phases and dependencies.
