## Prompt

```
/sp.specify Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo Application (Updated with Full Hackathon Context from Document Images) Spec ID: phase-1-in-memory-console-app Version: 1.1 (Updated) Phase: Phase I Author: sharjeel GitHub: https://github.com/sharrjeel6636 Date: December 31, 2025 References: Hackathon II Document (Pages 1–9, as provided in images) Project Constitution (previously established) Basic Level Features explicitly listed on Page 2 Objective Build a fully functional command-line Todo application in Python that stores tasks in memory only, using Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus as the exclusive implementation tools. This is the foundation for the 5-phase "Evolution of Todo" project. Strict Constraint (Page 2): "Constraint: You cannot write the code manually. You must refine the Spec until Claude Code generates the correct output." Required Features – Basic Level (Exact from Page 2) Implement all five core essentials: Add Task – Create new todo items Delete Task – Remove tasks from the list Update Task – Modify existing task details View Task List – Display all tasks Mark as Complete – Toggle task completion status Detailed Functional Requirements Task Model: Unique auto-incremented integer ID (starting at 1) Title (required string) Description (optional string) Completed status (boolean, default: False) Interactive REPL Menu (clear numbered options):textTodo CLI Menu: 1. Add task 2. View all tasks 3. Update task 4. Delete task 5. Toggle complete 6. Exit View Task List Output: Clear table or formatted list Show ID, Title, Status indicator (e.g., [ ] or [x]), and truncated Description Example:textID | Status | Title | Description ---|--------|------------------------|------------------------------- 1 | [x] | Buy groceries | Milk, eggs, bread 2 | [ ] | Finish hackathon Phase I Input Handling & Error Management: Validate non-empty title on add Validate valid integer ID where required Graceful messages for: invalid choice, task not found, invalid input In-Memory Storage: Use a list of dataclasses or dicts (no files, no database) Non-Functional Requirements Clean Code & Structure: Modular design (separate model, operations, CLI) Full type hints PEP 8 compliant, Black-formattable Meaningful names and comments where helpful Exact Project Structure (per Page 5 & Page 9 guidelines):texthackathon-todo/ ├── .spec-kit/ │ └── config.yaml ├── specs/ │ ├── constitution.md │ ├── phase-1/ │ │ └── 001-in-memory-console-app.md ← this spec │ └── history/ ← previous versions ├── src/ │ ├── __init__.py │ ├── main.py ← entry point │ ├── models.py ← Task dataclass │ └── cli.py ← menu & user interaction ├── CLAUDE.md ← root instructions for Claude Code ├── README.md ← setup + run instructions └── pyproject.toml ← UV config (no dependencies needed) Technology Stack (Exact from Page 5) Python 3.13+ UV (for project management and running) Claude Code Spec-Kit Plus Standard library only – no external packages Deliverables (Exact Match Required – Page 5) Public GitHub repository at: https://github.com/sharrjeel6636/hackathon-todo Repository must contain: Constitution file /specs folder with all specification files and history /src folder with complete, working Python source code README.md with: Project overview Setup: uv sync and uv run src/main.py Usage examples CLAUDE.md with clear instructions for Claude Code Working console application demonstrating: Adding tasks with title and description Listing all tasks with status indicators Updating task details Deleting tasks by ID Marking tasks as complete/incomplete Acceptance Criteria Runs cleanly with uv run src/main.py All 5 basic features fully functional All code 100% generated by Claude Code (traceable via specs and commits) Structure matches requirements exactly README.md and CLAUDE.md complete Ready for <90-second demo video Next Step Ready: This specification is now finalized and complete.

## Response snapshot

Successfully created the feature specification for the Phase I In-Memory Python Console Todo Application. The specification includes all required sections: User Scenarios & Testing with 6 prioritized user stories, Functional Requirements with 12 specific, testable requirements, Key Entities (Task and TaskList), and Success Criteria with 8 measurable outcomes. The specification adheres to all constraints from the feature description, including in-memory storage, Python 3.13+, and Claude Code generation requirements. Created branch '1-console-todo-app' and spec file at 'specs\phase-1\001-in-memory-console-app.md'. Also created a quality checklist at 'specs\phase-1\checklists\requirements.md'.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete feature specification created for the Phase I Todo CLI application
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/phase-1/001-in-memory-console-app.md, specs/phase-1/checklists/requirements.md, and create-new-feature.ps1
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create a technical implementation plan for the specification
- 🧠 Reflection: The specification comprehensively covers all required features and constraints for the Phase I implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin with /sp.plan to create the technical implementation plan
