## Prompt

```
/sp.plan for Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo Application
Plan ID: phase-1-implementation-plan
Version: 1.0
Date: December 31, 2025
Author: sharjeel
GitHub Repository: https://github.com/sharrjeel6636/hackathon-todo
Spec Reference: specs/phase-1/001-in-memory-console-app.md (Version 1.1)
Constitution Adherence: FULL – Zero manual code writing. All code generated exclusively by Claude Code via iterative spec refinement.
Objective
Create a complete, working in-memory Python console Todo application that satisfies all Phase I requirements from the official hackathon document (Pages 1–6). The app must implement the 5 Basic Level features and be fully reproducible via Spec-Kit Plus + Claude Code.
Overall Strategy
We will strictly follow the Spec-Kit Plus workflow:

/sp.specify → Completed (spec finalized)
/sp.plan → This document (high-level plan + phased task groups)
/sp.tasks → Break into small, atomic tasks suitable for Claude Code
/sp.implement → Execute each task one-by-one with Claude Code, refining prompts until output is perfect
Verification & Commit → Run locally with UV, commit generated code, push

Key Rule: If Claude Code output has any issue (formatting, logic, structure), we refine the task prompt/spec – we never edit the code manually.

Implementation Plan – Task Groups
Group 0: Project Foundation (Already in progress or complete)

Repository created and initialized at https://github.com/sharrjeel6636/hackathon-todo
Initial commit with folder structure and placeholder files
constitution.md and final spec committed

Group 1: Core Data Model

Define a clean Task dataclass with:
id: int (auto-increment)
title: str
description: str | None
completed: bool

Full type hints and sensible defaults

Group 2: In-Memory Storage & Operations

Create a global list or simple manager class to hold tasks
Implement pure functions or methods for:
add_task(title, description)
list_tasks() → formatted string with status indicators ([ ] / [x])
update_task(id, new_title, new_description)
delete_task(id)
toggle_complete(id)


Group 3: CLI Interface

Interactive REPL menu loop in main.py
Clear numbered menu (1–6 as specified)
Input validation and user-friendly error messages
Pretty-printed task list with columns or aligned format

Group 4: Supporting Files

README.md: Complete setup/run instructions using UV
CLAUDE.md: Precise instructions for future Claude Code interactions
pyproject.toml: Minimal UV config (Python 3.13, no deps)
Optional .spec-kit/config.yaml if needed

Group 5: Final Polish & Verification

Ensure clean output formatting with status indicators
Test full flow manually (add → view → update → toggle → delete)
Prepare <90-second demo video outline

Execution Order (Next Steps)

You: Confirm repository is live and initial structure committed
Me: Generate /sp.tasks – detailed atomic task list (5–8 tasks max)
You: Feed each task one-by-one to Claude Code (via your preferred interface)
You: Save generated files exactly as outputted
You: Commit after each successful task or group
Me: Help refine any task if Claude Code output needs improvement

Success Criteria for Phase I Completion

App runs perfectly with uv run src/main.py
All 5 basic features work with clear status indicators
All code 100% generated by Claude Code (traceable via commits)
Structure and deliverables match hackathon requirements exactly
Ready for submission by Dec 7, 2025 (we're ahead!)

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed the implementation planning for the Phase I In-Memory Python Console Todo Application. Created the implementation plan document and completed all required phases: Phase 0 (Research) to resolve technical clarifications, Phase 1 (Design & Contracts) to create data models, API contracts, and quickstart guide. All constitution adherence requirements were verified. Generated multiple artifacts including research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts, and updated CLAUDE.md with agent instructions.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan created for the Phase I Todo CLI application
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created specs/phase-1/002-implementation-plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, contracts/todo-api-contract.md, updated CLAUDE.md, and supporting scripts
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to break the plan into specific atomic tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: The implementation plan comprehensively covers all requirements and is ready for task breakdown

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin with /sp.tasks to create detailed task breakdown
